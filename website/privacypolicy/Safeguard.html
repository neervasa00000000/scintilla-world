    <h1>Privacy Policy for SafeGuard Extension</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 20, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how the SafeGuard browser extension ("the Extension," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information from users ("you" or "your") of the SafeGuard extension. SafeGuard is designed to enhance your security when interacting with Web3 applications and blockchain networks by providing risk assessments of transactions.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Minimization and Collection</h2>
    <p>The SafeGuard Extension operates with a strong commitment to data minimization. We only access and process the information strictly necessary to perform its stated function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Public Blockchain Transaction Data:</strong> The Extension intercepts and analyzes transaction requests initiated by your browser to public blockchain networks. This data typically includes recipient addresses, transaction values, contract interaction data (e.g., function calls and parameters), and the associated blockchain network ID. This information is inherently public on the blockchain.</li>
        <li><strong>No Private Key Access:</strong> Crucially, SafeGuard <strong>does not</strong> access, collect, store, or transmit your private keys, seed phrases, or any other sensitive wallet credentials. Your wallet security remains entirely in your control.</li>
        <li><strong>No Personal Identifiable Information (PII):</strong> We do not intentionally collect any personal identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, IP address, or browsing history outside of the immediate transaction context.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All transaction analysis and risk assessments are performed locally within your browser environment. No transaction data or related analysis results are sent to our servers or any third-party servers for processing or storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>The information accessed by SafeGuard is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To analyze and simulate blockchain transactions in real-time within your browser.</li>
        <li>To identify potential risks, malicious patterns, or suspicious activities related to proposed transactions.</li>
        <li>To display clear, actionable warnings and summaries to you before you approve a transaction.</li>
        <li>To block known malicious transactions based on publicly available security databases (e.g., blocklists).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use any collected information for advertising, marketing, or any purpose unrelated to the core security function of the Extension.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>As analysis is performed locally, the Extension does not store transaction data persistently on your device beyond the immediate context required for a pending transaction. Any temporary data used for analysis is purged once a transaction is approved, rejected, or expires.</p>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect the integrity of the Extension itself and the data it processes locally. However, please be aware that no software or internet transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

    <div class="disclaimer">
        <h2>4. Strict No Liability Clause &amp; Accuracy Disclaimer</h2>
        <p><strong>By using the SafeGuard Extension, you acknowledge and agree to the following:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Guarantee of Safety:</strong> While SafeGuard employs advanced techniques to detect and warn against various risks, it is an analytical tool and <strong>cannot guarantee 100% protection against all potential threats, vulnerabilities, lost funds, hacks, scams, or malicious actors in the Web3 ecosystem.</strong> The blockchain landscape is constantly evolving, and new attack vectors emerge regularly.</li>
            <li><strong>User Responsibility:</strong> You, the user, are solely responsible for verifying the legitimacy and safety of any transaction before approving it. SafeGuard's warnings and risk assessments are provided for informational purposes only and should not be considered as definitive financial, security, or legal advice.</li>
            <li><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> <strong>Under no circumstances shall the developers, contributors, or affiliates of the SafeGuard Extension be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages whatsoever, including but not limited to loss of funds, data, profits, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Extension; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Extension; (iii) any content obtained from the Extension; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>"Safe" Results Not a Warranty:</strong> A "Safe" or "Low Risk" assessment from SafeGuard does not constitute a warranty or guarantee of absolute safety. It merely indicates that no known or detectable malicious patterns were identified at the time of analysis. Users should always exercise caution and conduct their own due diligence.</li>
            <li><strong>External Links:</strong> The Extension may include links to third-party websites or services for additional information (e.g., blockchain explorers). This Privacy Policy does not cover those third-party sites, and we are not responsible for their privacy practices.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Extension after any modifications to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.</p>
